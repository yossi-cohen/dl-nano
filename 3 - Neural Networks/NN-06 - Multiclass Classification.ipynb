    "# Neural Networks - Multiclass Classification\n",
    "Multiclass classification is, (duh), when you distinguish between more than two categories (i.e. more than 2)\n",
    "- With handwritten digital recognition problem - 10 possible categories (0-9)\n",
    "  - How do you do that?\n",
    "  - Done using an extension of one vs. all classification\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "- Recognizing pedestrian, car, motorbike or truck\n",
    "  - Build a neural network with 4 output units\n",
    "  - Output a vector of four numbers\n",
    "    - 1 is 0/1 pedestrian\n",
    "    - 2 is 0/1 car\n",
    "    - 3 is 0/1 motorcycle\n",
    "    - 4 is 0/1 truck\n",
    "  - When image is a pedestrian get [1,0,0,0] and so on\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/Multiclass classification - 1.png\">\n",
    "  - Training set here is images of our four classifications\n",
    "  - While previously we'd written y as an integer {1,2,3,4}\n",
